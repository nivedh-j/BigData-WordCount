# BigData-WordCount
A simple implementation of the WordCount program using the Hadoop MapReduce framework. This project demonstrates the basics of distributed data processing by counting word frequencies in a text dataset. It serves as a practical model to understand Hadoopâ€™s MapReduce programming paradigm.
{
The Word Count program is a common example that shows how the MapReduce programming model works. It handles a big text file by breaking it into smaller parts. The Map part goes through each part and records every word with a count of 1. Then the Reduce part brings all those counts together to find out how many times each word appears. This simple program clearly shows how data can be processed at the same time using pairs of keys and values in systems that spread out the work.
